# Advent of Code 2021


## What is Advent of Code?
> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.
> Every day for 25 days this month you have small programming challenges that you need to solve to complete the "tree". Each day, the questions get a little bit harder to really push you to learn and improve your programming skills.

## Lost stars ⭐️?
You're minding your own business on a ship at sea when the overboard alarm goes off! You rush to see if you can help. 
Apparently, one of the Elves tripped and accidentally sent the sleigh keys flying into the ocean!

Before you know it, you're inside a submarine the Elves keep ready for situations like this. 
It's covered in Christmas lights (because of course it is), 
and it even has an experimental antenna that should be able to track the keys if you can boost its signal strength high enough; 
there's a little meter that indicates the antenna's signal strength by displaying 0-50 stars.

Your instincts tell you that in order to save Christmas, you'll need to get all fifty stars by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. 
Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; 
the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

I will try my best to participate regularly and constantly upload the code on this repository throughout this span of 25 Day.
