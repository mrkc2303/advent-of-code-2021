# Day-3 : Binary Diagnostic
## Part-1
### Problem Statement

The submarine has been making some odd creaking noises, so you ask it to produce a diagnostic report just in case.

The diagnostic report (your puzzle input) consists of a list of binary numbers which, when decoded properly, can tell you many useful things about the conditions of the submarine. The first parameter to check is the **power consumption**.

You need to use the binary numbers in the diagnostic report to generate two new binary numbers (called the **gamma rate** and the **epsilon rate**). The power consumption can then be found by multiplying the gamma rate by the epsilon rate.

Each bit in the gamma rate can be determined by finding the **most common bit in the corresponding position** of all numbers in the diagnostic report. For example, given the following diagnostic report:

```
00100
11110
10110
10111
10101
01111
00111
11100
10000
11001
00010
01010
```
