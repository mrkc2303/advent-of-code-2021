# Day-9: Smoke Basin
## Part-1
### Problem Statement

These caves seem to be lava tubes. Parts are even still volcanically active; small hydrothermal vents release smoke into the caves that slowly settles like rain.

If you can model how the smoke flows through the caves, you might be able to avoid it and be that much safer. The submarine generates a heightmap of the floor of the nearby caves for you (your puzzle input).

Smoke flows to the lowest point of the area it's in. For example, consider the following heightmap:

```
2199943210
3987894921
9856789892
8767896789
9899965678
```

Each number corresponds to the height of a particular location, where `9` is the highest and `0` is the lowest a location can be.
